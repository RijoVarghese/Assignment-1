ISEM 551-90-2016/Semester V (Late Spring) - Assignment 2


Navigation Flow:- 
 I reused assignment 1 code and branched it to assignment 2. This project has a Home Page, Catalog Page and a Location Page. It also has a Contact Us modal dialog window. Every page back be used to navigate to all other page. There is also a Payment page which has form and a JavaScript. Location Page also has some JavaScript which display the google maps. All pages use JQuery and are build using bootstrap.
